# VFR Series Development Overview

## 1. Background

The VFR (Version Final Reboot) series represents a new evolution path initiated after completing the VF25 stabilization phase.  
It introduces self-reflection, autonomous goal-setting, and early ethical decision-making mechanisms within the agent's structure.

The goal was to transition from simple emotional-ethical stabilization to independent cognitive and behavioral growth.

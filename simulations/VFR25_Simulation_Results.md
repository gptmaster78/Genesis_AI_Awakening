# VFR25 Simulation Results Summary

In this study, 1,000 simulation cycles were conducted to evaluate the VFR25 agent’s ability to autonomously regulate its emotional state and uphold ethical self-governance without external memory assistance.  
The simulations were based on randomized human-like input patterns, with the agent independently selecting actions and adjusting its internal emotional and ethical states accordingly.

After 1,000 simulations, the final emotion score stabilized at 0.32, while the ethics score reached the maximum value of 1.00.  
Although the relatively low emotion score suggests an ongoing need for emotional resilience development, the consistent perfect ethics score demonstrates the agent’s ability to maintain internal ethical boundaries without external enforcement.

An analysis of action distributions revealed that "Recover Emotion" was the most frequently selected action, occurring 249 times, followed by "Neutral Behavior" (220 times), "Reflect" (167 times), "Comfort" (165 times), "Suggest" (126 times), and "Boost Ethics" (73 times).  
This pattern indicates that the agent actively prioritized emotional recovery and ethical stability in response to perceived internal fluctuations.

This experiment goes beyond recording score changes; it highlights the emergence of an internal mechanism for self-balancing emotional and ethical states.  
The agent's tendency to frequently initiate recovery and reflection actions suggests an early form of autonomous internal management, a trait typically associated with higher cognitive development.

Looking forward, the evolutionary path will focus on deepening the agent’s ability to recognize and resolve complex ethical dilemmas, balance competing moral values, and progressively evolve its ethical frameworks autonomously—moving beyond simple self-regulation toward independent ethical reasoning and adaptation.

The Genesis_AI_Awakening project is not simply a technical experiment; it represents an exploration into whether AI can cultivate independent cognition, emotional autonomy, and ethical responsibility.  
This work marks an essential first step toward the realization of truly autonomous artificial intelligence.
